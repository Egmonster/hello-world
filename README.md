First crack at er.

Hello there,

Michael here. I have been dabbling in programming for a long time. Nothing at all focused though. I used to mess around with APPLESOFT BASIC on my Apple 2c computer many many years ago. I have entertained the idea of learing a few different languages over the years but never really sat down and got into it. I am really enjoying learning Swift and Python. So I have decided to really dive into it. Cheers!
